# 🐾 Shelter Intake & Adoption Patterns — Tableau Project
**Feb 2025 – Mar 2025**  
**Author:** *Oskar Diyali*

This project analyzes **160,000+ Austin Animal Center (AAC)** records to uncover trends in animal intake, adoption, breed clusters, and high-risk (euthanasia-likely) cases.  
Using Excel for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization, I built dashboards revealing **seasonality**, **breed concentration**, and **adoption/euthanasia patterns** across dogs and cats.

## 1. Project Overview
- Cleaned & standardized **150k+ outcome records** in Excel  
- Converted animal ages (days → years) using custom formulas  
- Encoded sterilization/sex outcomes  
- Removed 277 rows with missing critical data  
- Built Tableau dashboards showing major population patterns

AAC is a public no-kill shelter serving ~20,000 animals/year.  
Understanding intake trends helps improve staffing, resources, and animal outcomes.

## 2. Key Insights
- **40–60% seasonal intake surge** during warmer months  
- **Domestic Shorthair cats dominate** (14k+ cases)  
- **4k+ euthanasia-risk animals**  
- Dogs generally have **higher adoption** and **lower euthanasia** rates than cats  
- Breed, age, and sterilization status impact adoption likelihood
